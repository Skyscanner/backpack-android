# Contributing

In this document we describe how to set up this repository for development and the release process.

## Access

> Skyscanner employees only

Please ensure you have push rights to this repository, rather than forking the repository for contributions. Follow the "Engineering Contribution" guide in the Backpack space in confluence to get access.

## Environment

We use Node in this project. To manage the language runtime we recommend using [`nvm`][1]. The required Node version is in `.nvmrc`.

With `nvm`, use `nvm use` to set the correct Node version in your machine.

To set up the Android environment, install Android Studio. Make sure that "Android SDK Command-line Tools (latest)" are installed as well (in Android SDK manager). Once installed, use the following commands to set up the Android SDK:

```
echo "export ANDROID_HOME=\"$HOME/Library/Android/sdk\"" >> ~/.bash_profile
echo "export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=\"$HOME/Library/Android/sdk\"" >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
```

You may also have to install "Android SDK Command Line Tools" from the SDK tools screen in Android Studio.

Install system images
```
# x86
$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/sdkmanager "system-images;android-26;google_apis;x86"
$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/sdkmanager "system-images;android-30;google_apis;x86"

# ARM
$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/sdkmanager "system-images;android-26;google_apis;arm64-v8a"
$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/sdkmanager "system-images;android-30;google_apis;arm64-v8a"
```

## Setup

Given that you have a compatible environment as stated above you can now set up the project.

+ `npm install` to install npm dependencies
+ `npm run build` to build Backpack tokens
+  Open the project in Android Studio
+ If you are a Skyscanner employee, search the internal documentation for _"Guide â€“ Setup Internal Backpack Android Builds"_ and follow the instructions.

## Creating components

To create a new component in Compose you can use the following script to setup the most common required parts of a component.

To run it execute:
```
./scripts/generate-component.py
```
and follow instructions, or provide arguments directly:
```
./scripts/generate-component.py [NameOfComponent] [packagename]
```

Note: This currently is not supported for creating components using the view system.

## Testing

### Snapshot testing
We use snapshot testing to ensure there are no unintended changes to UI components.

#### Setup

> Note: Currently, snapshot tests run on Apple chips will result in a different snapshot to Intel-based laptops or CI.
> Consider recording snapshots on Intel-based macs or using GitHub Actions (see [below](#using-ci-for-generating-snapshot)).

Create an AVD using the following command

```
# x86
$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/avdmanager create avd --name "bpk-droid-avd" --force --package "system-images;android-26;google_apis;x86" --device "Nexus 4" && cp bpk-droid-local.ini ~/.android/avd/bpk-droid-avd.avd/config.ini


# ARM
$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/avdmanager create avd --name "bpk-droid-avd" --force --package "system-images;android-26;google_apis;arm64-v8a" --device "Nexus 4" && cp bpk-droid-local-arm.ini ~/.android/avd/bpk-droid-avd.avd/config.ini
```

Create an SD card for the snapshot tests

```
# Linux
$ANDROID_HOME/emulator/mksdcard -l e 512M sd.img
# OSX
hdiutil create -megabytes 512 -fs MS-DOS -layout NONE -o sd && mv sd.dmg sd.img
```

Make sure no emulator or physical devices are attached, otherwise tests will fail.
To start the emulator and attach an SD card to it, run

```
$ANDROID_HOME/emulator/emulator -avd bpk-droid-avd -sdcard sd.img &
```

#### Creating tests

Snapshot tests live in the `app` module. For a new test class extend from `BpkSnapshotTest`.
Each test function will result in a separate snapshot test - try to  keep the tests simple and add a test for each state of a component.

Wrap your component with the correct states in the `snap` function to take the snapshot. There are various configurations supported:

To set the dimension for your snapshot use the `width` and/or `height` property on the `snap()` function.

To set the background colour use the `background` property on the `snap` function. By default the snapshots will have the `canvas` background.

By default snapshot tests run on 4 variants - default, dark mode, RTL and themed (skipped for compose). In some cases you may want to only run a snapshot test on some variants - for example if a component has many different states without layout changes you may want to consider skipping RTL.
You can do this by adding the `@Variant` annotation to either the test class (applies to all tests in class) or function with the desired variants, like this:

```
@Variant(BpkTestVariant.Default, BpkTestVariant.DarkMode)
```

For some more complex components with many different types you may want to make use of the `Parameterized` test runner to test all variants.
To ensure snapshots get saved for all parameters pass the `tags` property in the `BpkSnapshotTest` constructor. For an example look at `BpkButtonTest`.

#### Verifying changes
After adding new snapshot tests or making UI changes, run

```
 ./scripts/record_snapshot_tests.sh
```

This will generate the latest snapshots. Verify the changes & generated snapshots are as expected and commit the changes.

To test changes use

```
./scripts/verify_screenshot_tests.sh
```

If the check fails you either need to fix the issue if a change was unintended or record script above instead to update the snapshots.

### Running individual test classes

While you're creating your snapshot tests or are debugging an issue it may be helpful to run an individual test class. You can do that with the following command:

```
./gradlew ossDebugExecuteScreenshotTests -Precord -PdirectorySuffix=default -Pandroid.testInstrumentationRunnerArguments.class=net.skyscanner.backpack.package.YourClassTest
```

You can replace the `directorySuffix` property with `dm`, `rtl` or `themed` depending on what you're trying to test.

> Note: Please do not commit these changes when using an Apple Chip machine - use the CI method below instead.

### Using CI for generating snapshot

Alternatively, you can use GitHub Actions CI to generate the snapshots. Simply add an empty commit with "Record snapshots" as a commit message:

```
git commit --allow-empty -m "Record snapshots" && git push
```

> Note: Please wait until all snapshots are updated before pushing any further changes as they'll cancel the updates.

Since CI run cannot trigger CI checks again, you need to commit something after the snapshots have been generated to trigger the CI check.

If you don't have any pending changes, you can use an empty commit again to trigger the CI:

```
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger CI" && git push
```

### Espresso tests
If your component contains logic that can't be verified via snapshot tests you can use espresso to test the logic. These tests live in the `Backpack` (for View components) or `backpack-compose` (for Compose components) module, depending on the component.

To run connected tests run

```
./gradlew Backpack:connectedCheck // for view components
./gradlew backpack-compose:connectedCheck // for compose components
```

### Deploying locally
To test your branch/implementation in a codebase, publish the dependency locally (replacing the version with your desired version):

```
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal -Pversion=x.x.x-SNAPSHOT
```

To use this dependency make sure to add `mavenLocal()` to your repository list in your codebase, as well as updating backpack to the snapshot version.
```
implementation 'net.skyscanner.backpack:backpack-android:x.x.x-SNAPSHOT'
```

## Demo app screens

To verify changes during development, generate docs screenshots and showcase our components internally & externally we provide a demo app with all our components.
To add a new component open `net/skyscanner/backpack/demo/data/ComponentRegistry.kt` and add your component to the list. For compose components use `composeStory` and use a newly created component story from the `compose` package. For view components you can add `story NodeData { Story of R.layout.fragment_x }` for simple components, or use a custom story instead of `Story` for more complex stories.

## Docs screenshots

To make our documentation clearer we include screenshots on the docs site for each components.

### Setup

Before running the script install and start the docs emulator.

```
# x86
$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/avdmanager --verbose create avd --force --name "bpk-droid-screenshot-avd" --device "pixel" --package "system-images;android-30;google_apis;x86" --tag "google_apis" --abi "x86"
$ANDROID_HOME/tools/emulator -avd bpk-droid-screenshot-avd


# ARM
$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/avdmanager --verbose create avd --force --name "bpk-droid-screenshot-avd" --device "pixel" --package "system-images;android-30;google_apis;arm64-v8a" --tag "google_apis" --abi "arm64-v8a"
$ANDROID_HOME/emulator/emulator -avd bpk-droid-screenshot-avd
```

### Generating screenshots

To add a new screenshot open `net/skyscanner/backpack/docs/DocsRegistry.kt` and add the screenshot to the `screenshots` list.
**Important**: For the screenshot to be generated the name must match the title of the page.

Run `./scripts/generate_screenshots.sh` to capture all screenshots. Files will be saved in the correct directory.

> Note: Python is required.

Verify the screenshots and commit the changes.

> Note: Unfortunately the screenshot generation may also contain changes to other screenshots. Unless they are intended remove these changes and only commit the ones with intended changes.

## Demo app shortcuts

- `Shift + D` : Toggle story view between RTL and LTR
- `Shift + T` : Hide the toolbar

## Code Style
Code style is ensured by [detekt](https://github.com/detekt/detekt). It runs automatically during the `check` phase but can also be executed by running `./gradlew detekt`.

To auto fix problems run `./gradlew detekt --auto-correct`.

## How we review Backpack contributions
