/**
 * Applies a progressive blur effect to the bottom half of the composable.
 *
 * The blur starts at the vertical midpoint and increases towards the bottom edge,
 * creating a visually appealing transition. This modifier uses a custom AGSL shader
 * for optimal performance and appearance on supported Android versions (API 33+).
 *
 * - The effect is clipped to the composable bounds.
 * - The blur strength and direction are handled via uniforms for two-pass chaining (X then Y).
 * - Falls back to a uniform blur on unsupported platforms.
 *
 * This modifier is designed to be accessible and themable, following Backpack's
 * component standards. It does not interfere with touch targets, semantics, or
 * theming, and is compatible with both light and dark modes.
